            transport hubs. By focusing on high-traffic areas, InfraCo ensures

            rural communities, gains access to the internet. This initiative not

          <p className='text-lg leading-7'>
            One of the critical impacts of InfraCo&apos;s public Wi-Fi
            initiatives is on education. By providing students with free access
            to the internet, InfraCo empowers them with the resources needed for
            research, online learning, and digital literacy. This access is
            vital for students in rural areas, where educational resources are
            often limited.

            Moreover, InfraCo&apos;s initiatives support local businesses and
            entrepreneurs by providing them with the internet access needed to
            connect with broader markets, utilize digital tools, and participate
            in the digital economy. This connectivity is crucial for fostering
            economic growth and innovation at the grassroots level.
