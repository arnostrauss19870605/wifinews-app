            Monetization as a Service
          </h2>
          <p className='text-lg leading-7'>
            YourSpot.tech has developed a unique &quot;Monetization as a
            Service&quot; model, which allows public Wi-Fi providers to generate
            revenue through advertising. This model involves using a captive
            portal where users log in to access free Wi-Fi. This portal serves
            as a platform for displaying targeted advertisements, promotions,
            and vouchers, ensuring that the service remains free for users while
            generating income for the provider.
